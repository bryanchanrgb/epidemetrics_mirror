	* README.md: Include a description of how to look a the vega-lite
	version of the figures in the browser which is the planned
	approach for the fine tuning of the figures.

	* generate_table.py: Removed the geometry column from the CSV
	exports for figure 1 data as pandas was thorwing errors while
	trying to serialise this.
