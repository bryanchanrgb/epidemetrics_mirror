The colour pallete used comes from [[https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=YlGnBu&n=3][colorbrewer2]].

** Figure 1 \(T_0\) Map

[[./output/png/figure-1-t0-map.png]]

=figure-1-t0-map.json= produces a choropleth showing the \(T_0\) across the
globe.

** Figure 1 \(T_0\) Wave State Boxplot

[[./output/png/figure-1-t0-wave-state-boxplot.png]]

=figure-1-t0-wave-state-boxplot.json= produces the boxplot of the \(T_0\)
stratified by the epidemic wave state. Due to a bug in Vega-Lite we use the
script =figure-1-t0-wave-state-boxplot.R= to compute the statistics of the
boxplot and write them to an appropriate JSON file.

** Figure 1 Cases And Deaths

[[./output/png/figure-1-cases-and-deaths.png]]

=figure-1-cases-and-deaths.json= produces the time series of confirmed cases and
deaths along with the LOESS smoothing. To get the data into a useful format
there is the script =figure-1-cases-and-deaths.R=

** Figure 1 \(T_0\) and GNI per capita

[[./output/png/figure-1-t0-and-gni.png]]

=figure-1-t0-and-gni.json= produces the scatter plot looking at GNI per capita
as a predictor of \(T_0\). The regression is a power law, but on the log-log
scale it appears linear. The outlier at 25 days is from China.
