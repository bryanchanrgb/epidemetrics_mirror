things to implement:

generate_table.py:
- Finish epidemiology columns V
- Finish mobility columns V
- Finish gov response columns V
- Convert epidemiology and gov response to country stats format 
- Consolidate into one dataframe
- Change threshold from 25th percentile to... (maybe mean-2stdev?)
- Fix peak/trough prominence on mobility table

ideas:
- Jacque bera test to determine whether it's a normal distribution or bimodal?? i.e. if the distribution scores highly on this test, its in it's first wave, otherwise it has multiple waves.
